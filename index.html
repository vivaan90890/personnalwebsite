<P>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time.Whenever I go home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 10 years old and read in class 5th standard.Now I know very well that reading is a good habbit which can make me a complete reader.This hobby can be developed by everyone however I got this naturally.Reading books keep one always happy and busy.It is a good source of enjoyment,knowledge,inspiration and instruction. It makes us disiplined,loyal,punctual and most importantly a succesful person in life.
